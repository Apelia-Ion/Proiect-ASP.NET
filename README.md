# Proiect-ASP.NET

This is the final project for the optional course of web application development at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Unibuc. The project was built using .Net and Angular.  



Welcome to Recipes app, a .NET project designed to provide a platform for users to discover new recipes, share their own culinary creations, and engage in a community of food enthusiasts.

With this app, users can browse a wide range of recipes from various cuisines and meal types, all uploaded by our talented chefs. Users can also upload their own recipes and receive feedback from the community, allowing them to improve their cooking skills and experiment with new flavors and techniques.

One of the unique features of our app is the ability for users to leave comments on recipes, providing valuable feedback to the chef and creating a dialogue between the creator and the community. This fosters a sense of community and allows users to share tips, tricks, and variations on the recipes.
